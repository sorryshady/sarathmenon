        <p>The joy in your life</p>

        <p>When our lips are close</p>
        <p>And our foreheads touch</p>
        <p>When our eyes are closed</p>

        <p>Come be with me</p>

        <p>Of the world and all</p>

        <p>Feed me milk</p>
        <p>And pat me to sleep</p>

        <p>Lola wanted her answers.</p>
        <p>“Then hear it.”</p>
        <p>And he came out of his shell and spoke,</p>
        <p>“Life is like a tortoise.</p>
        <p>Slow yet moving forward,</p>
        <p>Sometimes hard to notice,</p>
        <p>When it hides in the shell,</p>
        <p>Always beating itself down,</p>

        <p>Running a race it didn’t ask for,</p>

        <p>Pulling up the clothes</p>

        <p>The first hour of school</p>
        <p>Dingy and gloomy</p>

        <p>In the light of rain</p>
        <br />
        <p>The first bell rang</p>
        <p>And we looked outside</p>
        <p>At the puddles of water</p>
        <p>That welcomed feet</p>
        <br />
        <p>Our feet stayed still</p>
        <p>Under the cold desks</p>

          Like when you read a book, you are never the same person again by the
          time you finish.
        </p>

        <p>Some books, we love.</p>
        <p>Some others, we don’t feel like reading.</p>
        <p>Some others, we read and put down without completing.</p>
        <p>And some other books stay with us. We want to read them again.</p>
        <p>
          Every time adding a new perspective to our mind. Changing us. One page
          at a time.

        <p>You and I too.</p>

          Since I came across a book with such a pretty cover, I decided to find
          out what is inside.
        </p>

        <p>And inside I found such a lovely story filled with life.</p>
        <p>A life so familiar, that I couldn’t stop turning pages.</p>
        <p>
          Pages so rich in poetry, that I couldn’t help but wonder how the
          verses were crafted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Craft so lovely, that it comes only second to the cover of the book
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>The book so lovely, it has begun to change me.</p>
        <p>The book tells me the story of everything that I once used to be.</p>
        <p>Everything that I always wanted to be.</p>
        <p>And everything that I still hold deep within my heart.</p>
        <p>A story that I have always known to exist.</p>
        <p>A story, that only I thought I knew existed.</p>
        <p>
          When that story was told to me in the pages, I wondered, is this my
          story?
        </p>
        <p>Then I realised, the story is neither mine, nor anyone else’s.</p>
        <p>A story, a tale, is something you familiarise with.</p>

        <p>The pool is now dry</p>
        <p>But filled with his cry</p>
        <p>Tony didn’t know why</p>
        <p>She said her goodbye</p>
        <br />
        <p>Tony, learn your lesson</p>
        <p>That a life of oppression</p>
        <p>Must not be your profession</p>
        <p>Is my humble suggestion</p>

        <p>And the trees quite shy</p>

        <p>I am in your tears</p>
        <p>In your veins</p>
        <p>Under your feet</p>
        <p>And in your heart</p>
        <br />
        <p>Seek under roots</p>
        <p>I seep deep beneath</p>
        <p>I flow, I fly</p>
        <p>I crumble in a puddle</p>
        <br />
        <p>You were born in me</p>
        <p>I live through you</p>
        <p>And you die into me</p>

        <p>It has been long</p>
        <p>Since I have gone.</p>
        <br />
        <p>There is a trip ahead of me</p>
        <p>To a land I once called home.</p>
        <p>Alive, I feel at the thought of it</p>
        <p>Alone, I will never again be.</p>
        <br />
        <p>There is a home</p>
        <p>For me somewhere.</p>
        <p>Along with mine</p>
        <p>I am serene.</p>
        <br />
        <p>There shall be no tears</p>
        <p>Of sorrow or loss.</p>
        <p>Leave me in peace</p>
        <p>For I am in bliss.</p>

        <p>Years of life, have gone through</p>
        <p>Lessons of life, have been learned.</p>
        <p>It is now time for me to rest</p>
        <p>To go home and meet the rest.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Now I leave you, my kith and kin</p>
        <p>Bless you all from my within.</p>
        <p>In the sky, you shall see me shine</p>
        <p>For my soul does no sin.</p>

        <p>A mind stays afloat</p>

        <p>The endless hours inside</p>
